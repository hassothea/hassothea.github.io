The talk is about a mathematical model of data compression known as **Vector Quantization** and its algorithmic adaption, the well-known *K*-means algorithm. The goal of this talk is to show how the mathematical theories of vector quantization model became the fundamental structure of *K*-means clustering algorithm. It is also a good motivation for young cambodian pupils who are interested in mathematics and its applications. The slide can be found [here](/files/slide_rupp/kMeans.html).
