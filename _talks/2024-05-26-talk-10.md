This is an opening talk on statistics for [Mathematics Association of Cambodia](https://sites.google.com/view/mac-cambodia). It is a part of my activity in supervising a group of students in statistics and data science.
The talk is about Frequentist and Bayesian points of view in statistics. The slide can be found [here](https://hassothea.github.io/files/teaching/MAC/Freq_Bayes_Stat.html#1).
