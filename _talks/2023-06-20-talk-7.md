The talk took place at the [SCALES conference](https://model.uni-mainz.de/scales-conference-2023/) from 26th to 30th June 2023 in Mainz, Germany. It is about reconstructing GWMFs observed by super-pressure balloons of [Strat√©ole-2 campaign](https://strateole2.aeris-data.fr/) using ML and the description of large-scale flow from ERA5. It is the first part of my Postdoctoral research in atmospheric science. The slide can be found [here](/files/Postdoc/SCALES_Mainz.html).
