The talk is about reconstructing GWMFs observed by super-pressure balloons of [Stratéole-2 campaign](https://strateole2.aeris-data.fr/) using ML and the description of large-scale flow from ERA5. It is the first part of my Postdoctoral research in climate science and is a joint work with Riwal Bloungoven and Aurélie Fischer and other amazing people in this field. The slide can be found [here](/files/Postdoc/GWMF_using_ML.html).
