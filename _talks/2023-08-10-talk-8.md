This talk aims at providing key concepts of Machine Learning through real examples. Linear models in regression and classification are introduced along with some tasks. Some gradient-based optimization and penalization techniques are also discussed from Linear Regression to Deep Neural Networks. The slide can be found here: [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://hassothea.github.io/files/teaching/Intro_to_ML.html#1). For those who want to play with the codes, you can find `jupyter notebook` of the simulation here: [Teaching repository](https://github.com/hassothea/Teaching).
