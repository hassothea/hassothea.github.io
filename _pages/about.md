I am currently a third year PhD student in Statistical Learning at [UPMC - Sorbonne Université](http://www.upmc.fr/en/) under supervision of [Mathilde Mougeot](https://sites.google.com/site/mougeotmathilde/) and [Aurélie Fischer](http://www.lpsm.paris/dw/doku.php?id=users:fischer:index). I am from Cambodia. I also work as a teaching assistant at [UFR mathematics of Université de Paris (Paris 7)](https://www.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) during my thesis.
   
Research
======

My Ph.D. research focuses on consensual aggregation techniques for combining a given number (small or large) of predictors in supervised machine learning problems. Moreover, I am developing a procedure for constructing predictive models using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods involving consensual aggregation techniques and clustering with a broad class of dissimilarity measures known as Bregman divergences. I provide theoretical contributions and applications of the methods on the domain of energy. My thesis can be found [here](/files/Thèse_Manuscrit_SotheaHas.pdf).
