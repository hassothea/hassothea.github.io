I am Cambodian. Currently, I am a third year PhD student in Statistical Learning at [UPMC - Sorbonne Université](http://www.upmc.fr/en/) under supervision of [Mathilde Mougeot](https://sites.google.com/site/mougeotmathilde/) and [Aurélie Fischer](http://www.lpsm.paris/dw/doku.php?id=users:fischer:index). I am also working as a teaching assistant at [UFR mathematics of Université de Paris (Paris 7)](https://www.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/).
   
Research
======

My am working on consensual aggregation techniques for combining a given number (small or large) of predictors in supervised machine learning problems. Moreover, I am developing a procedure for constructing predictive models using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods involving consensual aggregation techniques and clustering using a broad class of dissimilarity measures known as Bregman divergences.

Research interests
======

- Combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods, ensemble learning, clustering and aggregation methods.
- Deep learning, neural networks, artificial intelligence, online learning, big data...
