I am currently doing my postdoctoral research in IMPT project on improving parameterizations of gravity wave momentum fluxes in climate models, using statistical and machine learning methods, under supervision of [Aurélie Fischer](http://www.lpsm.paris/dw/doku.php?id=users:fischer:index) (LPSM - Université Paris Cité) and [Riwal Plougonven](http://gershwin.ens.fr/plougon) (LMD/IPSL - École polytechnique). I am from Cambodia.

I did my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at [UPMC - Sorbonne Université](http://www.upmc.fr/en/) under supervision of [Mathilde Mougeot](https://sites.google.com/site/mougeotmathilde/) and [Aurélie Fischer](http://www.lpsm.paris/dw/doku.php?id=users:fischer:index). I also worked as a teaching assistant at [UFR mathematics of Université de Paris (Paris 7)](https://www.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) during my thesis.

Here are my [Ph.D. Thesis](/files/Thèse_Manuscrit_SotheaHAS.pdf) and [Slides](/files/slide_thesis/slide_thesis.html).
   
Research interests
======

My Ph.D. research focuses on consensual aggregation techniques for combining a given number (small or large) of predictors in supervised machine learning problems. Moreover, I developed a methodology ([KFC-procedure](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949655.2021.1891539)) for constructing predictions using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods including consensual aggregation methods and clustering. I provide theoretical contributions and applications of the methods on several simulated and real (energy) data.

I am interested in the following topics:
- Combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods, ensemble learning, clustering and aggregation methods.
- Deep learning, neural networks, artificial intelligence, online learning, big data...
