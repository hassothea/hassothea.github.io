I am currently a Senior Lecturer Researcher at [Mechatronics and Information Technology (MIT)](https://ric.itc.edu.kh/research_unit/mechatronics-and-information-technology-mit) of [Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC)](http://www.itc.edu.kh/fr/). 

I did my postdoctoral research in IMPT project on improving parameterizations of gravity wave momentum fluxes in climate models, using statistical and machine learning methods, under supervision of [Aurélie Fischer](http://www.lpsm.paris/dw/doku.php?id=users:fischer:index) (LPSM - Université Paris Cité) and [Riwal Plougonven](http://gershwin.ens.fr/plougon) (LMD/IPSL - École Polytechnique). My postdoctoral project was a part of the [DataWave: Collaborative Gravity Wave Research](https://datawaveproject.github.io/).

I did my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at [UPMC - Sorbonne Université](http://www.upmc.fr/en/). During my thesis, I also worked as a teaching assistant at [UFR Mathematics of Université Paris Cité (Paris 7)](https://www.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/).

Here is my [Ph.D. Thesis](/files/Thèse_Manuscrit_SotheaHAS.pdf) and [Slides](/files/slide_thesis/slide_thesis.html).
   
Research interests
======

My Ph.D. research focuses on consensual aggregation techniques for combining a given number (small or large) of predictors in supervised machine learning problems. Moreover, I also explored the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods for prediction. 

My postdoctoral research focuses on using ML methods to reconstruct balloon-observed [gravity wave momentum fluxes](https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/Miscellaneous/gravity_wave/gravity_wave.html) from the large-scale flow variables of [ERA5 dataset](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5).

<!-- Moreover, I developed a methodology ([KFC-procedure](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949655.2021.1891539)) for constructing predictions using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods including consensual aggregation methods and clustering. I provide theoretical contributions and applications of the methods on several simulated and real (energy) data. -->

I am interested in the following topics:
- Combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods, ensemble learning, clustering and aggregation methods.
- Deep learning, neural networks, artificial intelligence, online learning, big data...
